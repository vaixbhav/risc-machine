
# RISC Machine

Designed the architecture of the RISC Machine writing synthesizable Verilog HDL, including components such as an ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), register file, instruction decoder, CPU, and RAM. Specified the data path for executing instructions and pipelined the processor ensuring performance of instruction execution was optimized. Implemented significant ARMv7 operations including CMP, SUB, HALT as well as load (LDR) and store (STR) operations to maintain a memory system within the machine.

Simulated RISC machine instructions by developing exhaustive Verilog test benches in ModelSim and presented instructions on De1-SoC FPGA. Developed "assembler" to convert assembly code into programs to load into memory.
